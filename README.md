# LingvoKonstruoDatumInterfacIlo
An all-round data storage alternatives and interfaces for language construction purposes only, nonetheless. General-purpose one will out in the upcoming repo, or after several repos.
The name of this repo (where "lingvo": "language", "konstruo": "construction", "datumoj": "data", "interfacoj": "interfaces", "-ilo": "tool") is derived from a constructed language (conlang) namely Esperanto. This repo's name will be changed with my own conlang words.
