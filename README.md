# LingvoKonstruoDatumInterfacIlo
An all-round data storage alternatives and interfaces for the creation of constructed language, and in the future, as well as proramming language.
The name of this repo (where "lingvo": "language", "konstruo": "construction", "datumoj": "data", "interfacoj": "interfaces", "-ilo": "tool") is derived from a constructed language (conlang) namely Esperanto. This repo's name will be changed with my own conlang words.
