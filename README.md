# Notice
Check out branch `tentative` to see the placeholder project structure. Most of the files are intentionally empty as they fall under to-do list for the project. Some files, like `ConsoleInterface.java`, only displays the class, variable, and method signatures, excluding the implementations until a cleaner yet stable version is set.
